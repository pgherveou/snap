## Usage

```javascript
var snapper = new Snap({
  element: document.getElementById('content')
});
```

## Settings and Defaults
```javascript
settings = {
    element: null,
    disable: 'none',
    addBodyClasses: true,
    resistance: 0.5,
    flickThreshold: 50,
    transitionSpeed: 0.3,
    easing: 'ease',
    maxPosition: 266,
    minPosition: -266,
    tapToClose: true,
    touchToDrag: true,
    slideIntent: 40,
    minDragDistance: 5
}
```

* **`element`**: The element which the user will be sliding side to side
* **`disable`**: String, set to 'left' or 'right' to disable the respective side
* **`addBodyClasses`**: Add classes to the body to signify which side is being opened
* **`resistance`**: The cooeficcient used to slow sliding when user has passed max or min threshold
* **`flickThreshold`**: Number of pixels the user needs to swiftly travel to activate a "flick" open
* **`transitionSpeed`**: The speed at which the pane slides open or closed
* **`easing`**: The CSS3 Easing method you want to use for transitions
* **`maxPosition`**: Maximum number of pixels the pane may be slid to the right
* **`minPosition`**: Maximum number of pixels the pane may be slid to the left
* `tapToClose`: If true, tapping an open pane will close it
* `touchToDrag`: If true, dragging the target `settings.element` will open/close the pane
* **`minDragDistance`**: The minimum amount of pixels the user needs to drag within the `slideIntent` degrees to move the pane 
* **`slideIntent`**: The number of degrees the user must initiate sliding in towards the left or right (see diagram below)

Notes on Slide Intent: The slide intent is an int between 0 and 90, and represents the degrees in the first quadrant of a circle that you would like to have mirrored on the X *and* Y axis. For example, if you have 40 set as your `slideIntent` value, the user would only be able to slide the pane by dragging in the blue area in the diagram below. Once intent has been defined, it will not change until the user releases.

## Public Methods

### `open`: Opens the pane to the specified side

```javascript
snapper.open('left');
// OR
snapper.open('right');
```

### `close`: Closes the pane

```javascript
snapper.close();
```

### `expose`: Opens the pane entirely

```javascript
snapper.expose('left');
// OR
snapper.expose('right');
```

### `disable`: Disables sliding events

```javascript
snapper.disable();
```

### `enable`: Enables sliding events after disabling

```javascript
snapper.enable();
```

### `on`: Adds an event hook

```javascript
snapper.on('start', function(){
  // Do Something
});
```
The available methods to hook into are as follows:

* `start`: Fired when touching down on the draggable pane and it begins to move
* `drag`: Fired when the pane has been moved or slid
* `stop`: Fired when the pane has been let go od
* `animating`: Fired when the pane is animating
* `animated`: Fired when the pane is finished it's animations
* `ignore`: Fired when trying to drag the pane but ended up dragging on an ignored element

### `off`: Removes an event hook

```javascript
snapper.off('drag');
```
The event names listed above apply for the `off` method.


### `state`: Returns detailed information about the state of the pane

```javascript
var data = snapper.state();
```
The data returned from the `state` method will look like the following:

```javascript
{
    state: "closed", // State of the Pane
    info:{
        opening: "left", // Side which user intends to open
        towards: "right", // Direction user is dragging towards
        hyperExtending: false, // True if user is pulling past predefined bounds
        halfway: false, // True if pane is at least halfway open
        flick: false, // True if user has moved pane X amount of pixels in the open/close direction without changing directions
        translation:{
            absolute: 20, // Pixels pane has translated
            relative: 21, // Pixels pane has translated relative to starting translation
            sinceDirectionChange: 10, // Pixels pane has translated since the direction of the pane has changed
            percentage: 40.571649 // The percentage that the Pane is open. Good or animating other things
        }
    }
} 
```

### Toggles
With the provided API, Toggles can be done like the following:

```javascript
myToggleButton.addEventListener('click', function(){

    if( snapper.state().state=="left" ){
        snapper.close();
    } else {
        snapper.open('left');
    }

});
```

## Gotchas

### Layout
The layout itself is what most people will have a hard time emulating, so the simplest approach I have found is as follows:

Two absolute elements, one to represent *all* the content, and another to represent *all* the drawers. The content has a higher z-index than the drawers. Within the drawers element, it's direct children should represent the containers for the drawers, these should be `fixed` or `absolute`. Assigning classes to your drawers to specify which side it is on is recommended. All absolutely positioned elements should have 0 for `top, left, right, bottom` properties, excluding your panes which will have `auto` set to their respective sides and a width assigned. The width of your drawers is usually the same number you want to use for `minPosition` and `maxPosition`

```html
div.drawers {position: absolute;}
    div.left-drawer  {position: absolute;}
        [content]
    div.right-drawer  {position: absolute;}
        [content]
div#content {position: absolute;}
    [top-bars]
    [content] {overflow: auto}
    [bottom-bars]
```

A sample layout is found in demo/apps/default.html.

### Independent Scrolling
Some CSS is required to get some smooth ass scrolling. Utilize the CSS below to apply this to any of your elements:
```css
.scrollable{
    overflow: auto;
    -webkit-transition-property: top, bottom;
    transition-property: top, bottom;
    -webkit-transition-duration: .2s, .2s;
    transition-duration: .2s, .2s;
    -webkit-transition-timing-function: linear, linear;
    transition-timing-function: linear, linear;
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
}
```

### Z-Indeces and Display
Because of the nature of this code, drawers are just kind of stacked behind the content. To bring the proper drawer to the front, you can hook into Snaps event system:

```javascript
var UpdateDrawers = function(){
  var state = snapper.state(),
        towards = state.info.towards,
        opening = state.info.opening;
    if(opening=='right' && towards=='left'){
        // Revealing Right Drawer, apply CSS to that droor to bring it to the front.
    // Usually, display:block works if you set all panes to display:none;
    } else if(opening=='left' && towards=='right') {
        // Revealing left Drawer
    }
};

// Bind Events
snapper.on('drag', UpdateDrawers);
snapper.on('animating', UpdateDrawers);
snapper.on('animated', UpdateDrawers);
```

An example of this code in action can be found in demo/apps/ratchet/template.html


### Z-Indeces and Display *UPDATED*
Since having expanded upon this library, there is now a much simpler way to hook thisd functionality with just CSS.

With `addBodyClasses` set to `true` in your initialize options, one of the two classess will be added to the body tag: `.snapjs-left` or `.snapjs-right`, depending on which pane is being open, respectively. This being said, you can apply your CSS like the following:

```css
.left-drawer{ z-index: 3; }
.right-drawer{ z-index: 2; } // Right drawer element appears underneath the left drawer, 
.snapjs-right .right-drawer{ z-index: 4; } // but when the right drawer is being opened, we can set its z-index higher than the left drawer
```
